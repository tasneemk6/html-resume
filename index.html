    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        A hardworking and diligent student, 
        I am a quick learner who is passionate about 
        computer science - always ready to explore more 
        about the field. As I have taken relevant modules
        this year in university, I hope to bring some 
        previous knowledge in the required topics to 
        any future internship positions. I also hope to 
        develop my project management, collaboration, 
        and communication skills.
